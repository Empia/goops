# goops
goops is a command line tool that adds a .gitignore file to your current
working directory. It's a little more helpful than that though, goops will
analyze the files in your directory and determine the best .gitignore for
your project based on a simple heuristic or offer you a list of potential
.gitignore files to choose from.

## Installation

npm install --global goops
